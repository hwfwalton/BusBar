BusBar
======

Creates a persistent notification for checking bus times quickly.
Currently in Development. Functions, but bus stops are hardcoded in. Next step is to finish GUI for selecting bus stops.

Long term vision:
Should be able to work with any NextBus bus service
Use GPS to dynamically choose the closest bus stop to display times for.
